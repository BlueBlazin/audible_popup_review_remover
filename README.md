## Audible Popup Review Remover

This simple Chrome extension removes the random, usually low quality, review that Audible adds to the info popup displayed when you hover over a book title on the website.

**Q: Why get rid of the random review?**

**A:** The review is a single, usually not very representative, sample from a large number of reviews. If you want to read reviews go through the review page. There is almost never a reason you'd want to read a useless two word review like `(1-star) "Poor Read"` if the vast majority of reviews are overwhelmingly positive. For me, these reviews affect my opinion, maybe you're more resilient.
